Use <MainExample.c> as a skeleton to create your own applications adding relative
small amound of code. You can also use <Main.c> which contains comments if you are
not familiar.


First of All you have to Callibrate the Code to your Relative Window Coordinates. :/
Else the Mouse Won't point at excactly correct coordinates.

To do that run the "Callibrate_BPLcc_2D.exe" file and clik at the upper left corder to
the yellow pixel. This point will be the Origin of your drawing. You will take 2
numbers, x and y. In your code's replace them at the BPLcc_Window_Parameters_Set()
function as the "Callibrate_BPLcc_2D.exe" suggest. That's all!..

But keep in mind that if you run the application to another PC without the same
"settings" as your's pc, the application might be a little different. - I can't over
come this... If anyone else can... :)



To change Application ICON add the code:
   BPLcc_WinData_SetID(&h2D, BPLCC_INITWINOBJ_ICON, (LPCSTR) ID_YOURICON, false);
at the end of BPLcc_Window_Parameters_Set() function of the Skeleton Code.
where ID_YOURICON must be the indentifier of your resource ICON.


To change Application Cursor add the code:
   BPLcc_WinData_SetID(&h2D, BPLCC_INITWINOBJ_CURSOR, (LPCSTR) ID_YOURCURSOR, false);
at the end of BPLcc_Window_Parameters_Set() function of the Skeleton Code.
where ID_YOURCURSOR must be the indentifier of your resource CURsOR.
