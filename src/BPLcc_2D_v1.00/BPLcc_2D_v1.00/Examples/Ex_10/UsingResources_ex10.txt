How To Include Resources in Lcc-Win32 IDE.

From the menu go to <Design> and select <Open/New>

For creating a new resource, give a name where it asks for a filename.
F.E:
"Resources"   and klik open button.

The go again to the <Design> select <New> and then the resource you want.

Here we are going to Add .BMP images as resources for our BitMaps. So from the
<new> select <Bitmap>

Give An Identification name to the Bitmap f.e. ID_SPR1 (Default is: IDBITMAP100), an
identification Value >= 100 (Default 100), and then browse the .BMP file that
you are going to use as resource.

In this example the file is at: ./Resources/Res_SPR1.bmp

Then Select <File> - <Save> and close the Window with the resources.

Include the resource header file that has created to your .c file.

Select <File>-<open> and open the Resource file you just created (.rc). When asked:
"Open as a Resource file" answer NO.

From the .rc file you just opened, delete the 2-4 lines which writing:
#ifdef __LCC__
#include <windows.h>
#endif
The above code must be deleted or the resource makes errors - redefinitions! :/

Save the .rc file and add it you your project: <Project>-<add/delete files>

Now you can use the resource ID_SPR1, which corresponds to Res_SPR1.bmp.

The Nice thing with resources, is that all data can be inside the .exe file, without
having to support your application with extra files.
