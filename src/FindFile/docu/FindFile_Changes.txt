25th February 2005. Version 1.5.1.3 (JF)
Changed code in the DoShellExecuteEx() function that puts 
quotes around a filename. This has been added so that paths 
with spaces do not cause problems with certain applications.
(FireFox for example will not accept paths with spaces.)

26th December 2004, Version 1.5.1.1 (SZ)
+ Sort also by Folders in Listview
* Sort UI changed, sort increasing at first click,
  remember sorting direction only for last sorted column

20th September 2004. The 'Browse for folder' (BROWSE) option (JF)
started with 'Desktop/My Documents', changed to start with 
'C:\' which makes folder navigation a little easier for most 
operations.

8th September 2004. FindFile searches for folders as well as files. (JF)

29th June 2004. When searching with extended dates and sizes, (JF)
FindFile would not deal with the dates. Thanks to Stephan Zorn 
for reporting that.

28th June 2004. Bug fixed and a new dialog added. Also this version (JF)
works with the ContextMenuExt.dll that you will find in the 
OLE & COM section. 
  
4th June 2004. Commandline extensions have been added by Stephan Zorn. (SZ)
Stephan has explained the switches in a text file, 'findfile_cmdline.txt'. 

All changes before 4th June 2004 were not documented.
