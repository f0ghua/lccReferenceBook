The TEMPLATE directory contains "Empty Project" templates for Wise 8 and
Wise 9 that have Wise's standard Directory Tree Browse control in the
"Select Destination Directory" dialog replaced with the advanced
Directory Tree Browse dialog in shbffo.dll. Copy all files from the
appropriate subdirectory to the TEMPLATE subdirectory of your Wise
installation directory. Don't forget to make a backup of the existing
"Empty Project.wse" file.

Selecting "File - New - Empty Project" in Wise now uses the modified
template.
